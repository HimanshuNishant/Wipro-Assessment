# Write a program to count the number of upper and lower case letters in a String.


# Write a program that will check whether a given String is Palindrome or not.


# Given a string, return a new string made of n copies of the first 2 chars of the original string where n is the length of the string. The string length will be >=2. 


# Given a string, if the first or last character is 'x', return the string without those 'x' character, else return the string unchanged. If the input is "xHix", then output is "Hi".

# Given a string and an integer n, return a string made of n repetitions of the last n characters of the string. You may assume that n is between 0 and the length of the string inclusive. For example if the inputs are “Wipro” and 3, then the output should be “propropro”.
